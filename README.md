What has been done:
     - Java, Maven, TestNG, Selenium, PageObject, PageFactory, testreport (Surefire), WebDriverManager (support for next browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Current implementation has only one cofigured (initialized) browser (Chrome)
     
     Tests can be executed using maven (mvn test)
     
     NOTE: Test Case2 cannot be passed successful as the 7th step fails - link doesn't contain theme's name (more details after run in surefire-report)
